# SPA ClientApp created using the Aurelia CLI

Aurelia CLI was used to create the ClientApp dir, the Aurelia templates files from the retired "Microsoft.AspNetCore.SpaTemplate" package were then added to create the project template as generated by that package (looks the same as the Angular template). The Aurelia project structure was tweaked slightly to be more inline with what the Aurelia CLI generated.

Those templates are now retired:
https://github.com/aspnet/Announcements/issues/289
The new ones will no longer contain Aurelia/Knockout/Vue templates.

# Build Notes

To obtain the files from the old Aurelia template, use the SpaTemplate generator from dotnet 2.0

```dotnet new --install Microsoft.AspNetCore.SpaTemplate```

```dotnet new aurelia```

### Install the Aurelia CLI
```npm install aurelia-cli -g```

### Aurelia Project Creation and Configuration

Rename / move or delete the existing ClietApp dir.
Run this from within the dotnet project folder:

```au new```

Options chosen:

    Name: ClientApp
    Platform: Web
    Bundler: Webpack
    Loader: None
    Transpiler: TypeScript
    Markup Processor: Minimal Minification
    CSS Processor: None
    Unit Test Runner: None
    Integration Test Runner: None
    Editor: Visual Studio Code
Would you like to install the project dependencies?

    2. Yes, use NPM

##### Output

> "Congratulations! Your Project "ClientApp" Has Been Created!"

> "Getting started"

> "Now it's time for you to get started. It's easy. First, change directory into your new project's
folder. You can use cd ClientApp to get there. Once in your project folder, simply run your new app with au
run. Your app will run fully bundled. If you would like to have it auto-refresh whenever you make changes to your HTML, JavaScript or CSS, simply use the --watch flag If you want to build your app for production, run au build --env prod. That's just about all there is to it. If you need help, simply run au help."

> Now run your aurelia dev server with:

> au run --watch --hmr
> or
> npm start

A new ClientApp dir will now have been generated.

### Update the ClientApp dir

Add the files from the old dotnet generated Aurelia template to the ClientApp project generated by the CLI.
Re-structure the files if required.

This process can also be used to migrate an existing Aurelia App to the CLI / Webpack that was built using a different build system such as Gulp using module loaders such as SystemJS or RequireJS.
